### Gmail

So by the time you reached this place, Mr. Duy should have done creating your email address. You can go to [Gmail](https://gmail.com) to sign in. First sign in requires a change in default email.

### Slack

We use Slack for our internal communication. It is also a great way to get to know each others name and map a face to a name. You can use your Gmail address to create an account [here](https://dinovative.slack.com/).

### Github

Developers should know by now we are using [Github](https://github.com/dinosysOrg/) as our center repository system. Once you created a Slack account, please ping [Duy](https://dinovative.slack.com/messages/D8U57T2DU/) with your Github account, he will be adding you to the necessary repositories.

### Jira

Jira is another tool that you will be using a lot. We self host Jira on our Data Center and use it as a Project Management Tool. Receiving task, keep track of task and reporting of done task is all done through [Jira](http://jira.atlassian.dinovative.com/). Make sure you have access to that before jumping on to any project.
