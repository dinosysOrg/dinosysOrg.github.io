### Branching

[Github Flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) is widely being used in Dinovative. The difference in each project would be only on how we name our feature branches, are we forking from the repository or we use the same remote with different branch and create a pull request from that to the master/develop branch or not. The only thing we require you to do is to follow Github Flow, the rest will be reinforced by the tech lead of each project.

### Pull Request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository. Detailed about how to create one and what are the flows for approving one is all stated in the Github Documentation above. Generic rule is that every PR needs to be reviewed by at least 1 person in a team.

### Github - Jira Relationship

Technically speaking, all Github PR's should be related to a Jira ticket, for that reason, any PR created should have link to it's Jira ticket and vice-versa.
